Consider a full binary tree with an infinite number of levels. The vertices are labeled with positive integers, starting from the root and moving down the tree, from left to right on each level. In the example below you can see the first 44 levels of the tree:

Answer qq (1 \leq q \leq 10^6)(1≤q≤10
​6
​​ ) queries of the form: find the minimum distance between vertices aa and bb (1 \leq a, b \leq 10^{18})(1≤a,b≤10
​18
​​ ).

Standard input
The first line contains integer qq.

The next qq lines contain two integers, aa and bb.

Standard output
Print qq lines, on line ii the answer for the i^{th}i
​th
​​  query.
