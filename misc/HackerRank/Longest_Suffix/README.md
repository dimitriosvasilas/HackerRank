Today Jarawi had a job interview for a very important tech company, the interviewer asked him to solve the next problem: 

Given a string ss (1 \leq |s| \leq 10^6)(1≤∣s∣≤10
​6
​​ ), answer qq (1 \leq q \leq 5 * 10^4)(1≤q≤5∗10
​4
​​ ) queries. For each query he received a string p_ip
​i
​​  (1 \le |p_i| \le 100)(1≤∣p
​i
​​ ∣≤100) and he had to determine the size of the longest suffix of p_ip
​i
​​  which is a subsequence of ss (a suffix of a string is a substring that occurs at the end).

Unfortunately Jarawi could not solve the task, so he wants to know if you can solve it.

Standard input
The first line contains a string ss.

The second line contains an integer qq.

Each of the next qq lines contains a string p_ip
​i
​​ .

Standard output
For each query you need to print the size of the longest suffix of p_ip
​i
​​  which is a subsequence of ss.
